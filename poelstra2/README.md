This tree shows an example of having all 'native' Typescript packages.

This version was copied from `poelstra1`, with the following changes:
* all typings are directly generated by Typescript (i.e. `"declaration": true` in `tsconfig.json`)
  * note that all typings are generated without `declare module "..." { }` and don't have `/// <reference>` lines
* `def/` directories removed and `js/` renamed to `dist/` to reflect the fact that both `.js` and `.d.ts` are now emitted in that folder
* `typescript.definition` replaced by `typings` in `package.json` files, to match current proposal in https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/2338

It currently (2015-04-21) doesn't compile (using tsc 1.5.0-alpha), but it should compile without further changes if/when
https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/2338 is implemented.
