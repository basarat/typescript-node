This tree shows an example of having two 'native' Typescript packages, that both use a different version of the same non-TS package.

This version was copied from `poelstra2`, with the following changes:
* `myutils` was changed to look like a 'plain' JS package, without TS code nor typings
* `mylib` and `myotherlib` both include typings for their version of `myutils`, which differ

Interesting things to note:
* the typings for `myutils` are exactly the same as typings generated by `tsc`, i.e.
  * not wrapped in `declare module "..." { }`
  * no  `/// <reference>` lines are necessary
* both versions of `myutils` can co-exist, i.e. the results from the function calls in `myprogram.ts` can be resolved

It currently (2015-04-21) doesn't compile (using tsc 1.5.0-alpha), but it should compile without further changes if/when
https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/2338 and https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/2839 are implemented.

Note that e.g. an assumption has been made that the default 'include path' to look for typings is `typings/`. It may be that this needs to
be configured in e.g. a `tsconfig.json`, based on future changes to the existing proposals.
